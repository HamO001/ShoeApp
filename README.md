Usage
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Run tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests for more information.

Build for production:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

Eject the configuration:

bash
Copy code
npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
